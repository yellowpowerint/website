The `pscp` command isn't found. You need to run the upload from **Windows PowerShell**, not PuTTY. Let me give you the correct steps:

**On Windows (PowerShell/Command Prompt):**

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\Plange\Downloads\Projects"
pscp setup-github-autodeploy.sh root@216.158.230.187:/root/
```

Enter your VPS password when prompted.

**Then in PuTTY:**

```bash
chmod +x /root/setup-github-autodeploy.sh
/root/setup-github-autodeploy.sh
```

The script will install the webhook listener and configure everything. It will output the webhook secrets and URLs that you'll need to configure in GitHub.

Try uploading from Windows PowerShell first, then run the script in PuTTY.
